            </P>
                <h4>Feeding</h4>
            <ul>
                Provide a balanced, age-appropriate diet.<br>
                Always provide fresh water, and avoid overfeeding to prevent obesity.<br>
                Use high-quality food with proper protein, fats, and vitamins for overall health.<br>
            </ul>
            <h4>Exercise</h4>
            <ul>
                Regular exercise is crucial for physical and mental health.<br>
                Walking, running, and interactive playtime are great ways to keep them active.<br>
                For high-energy breeds, consider activities like agility training or fetch.
            </ul>
            <h4>Grooming</h4>
            <ul>
                Brush your dog's coat regularly to remove loose fur and reduce shedding.<br>
                The frequency of grooming depends on the breed.<br>
                Trim nails regularly to prevent overgrowth and discomfort.<br>
                Clean ears and teeth, and bathe when necessary to keep your dog hygienic and fresh.
            </ul>
            <h4>Health Checkup</h4>
            <ul>
                Regular vet visits are essential for vaccinations, flea/tick treatments, and overall health monitoring.<br>
                Keep up with preventive care, including dental hygiene, flea/tick control, and heartworm prevention.<br>
                Watch for changes in appetite, behavior, or energy levels, as these could indicate health issues.
            </ul>
            <h4>Training</h4>
            <ul>
                Consistent training helps your dog behave well and strengthens the bond between you and your pet.<br>
                Start with basic commands like “sit,” “stay,” and “come,” and gradually work on advanced training.
            </ul>

            <h3>Cat Care</h3>
    <p>
            <img src="https://www.dailypaws.com/thmb/btG0HwyZAC73_9KZwISD_3iQp2k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/brushing-cat-1251467566-2000-7577c38801e14ca58aaaf99933e05b69.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
    </p>
            <h4>Feeding</h4>
            <ul>
                Feed your cat a high-quality, balanced diet tailored to their age, health, and activity level.<br>
                Kittens need more protein and calories than adult cats.<br>
                Provide both wet and dry food to maintain hydration and dental health.
                Ensure fresh water is always available.
            </ul>
            <h4>Litter Box Maintenance</h4>
            <ul>
                Keep the litter box clean and scoop it daily to maintain hygiene. Cats are very particular about cleanliness.<br>
                Place the litter box in a quiet, low-traffic area to give your cat privacy.<br>
                Use the right type of litter (clumping or non-clumping) based on your cat's preference.
            </ul>
            <h4>Grooming</h4>
            <ul>
                Regular brushing helps prevent matting and reduces shedding.<br>
                Long-haired cats need more frequent grooming than short-haired ones.<br>
                Trim your cat's nails every few weeks to prevent overgrowth and discomfort.<br>
                Clean your cat’s ears and eyes as needed to avoid infection.
            </ul>

            <h4>Health Checkup</h4>
            <ul>
                Regular vet visits are important for vaccinations, flea/tick prevention, and general health monitoring.<br>
                Watch for signs of illness, such as changes in appetite, behavior, or litter box habits, and consult a vet promptly.<br>
                Dental care is essential—check your cat’s teeth regularly and consider providing dental treats or toys.
            </ul>
